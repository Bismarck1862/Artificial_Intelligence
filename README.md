# Genetic Algorithm

Code of genetic algorithm solving Facility Layout Optimization problem.
Source json files were delivered as part of the artificial intelligence laboratory course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology.

Code includes:
* loading start configuration (costs and flow)
* creating random start population
* genetic operators:
  * selection (roulette and tournament)
  * crossover
  * mutation
* creating pyplot charts of algorithm run
